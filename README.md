# Vue-slots

This repository contains the source code to explain the implementation of vue-slots, here is a link to the live implementation of this repository on [codesandbox](). 
With vue slots you can pass properties of a child component into it's parent component and sometimes allow the parent component have access to some of the data in the child components as props using scoped slots.

This repository shows a simple application that passes forms and buttons between components and allow the forms and buttons to be reusable based on usage. It implements scoped slots, binding data with vue-slots, passing data dynamically, naming slots and so on.
